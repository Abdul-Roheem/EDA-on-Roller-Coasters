# EDA-on-Roller-Coasters
# Roller Coaster Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores a dataset of roller coasters, analyzing various factors such as height, speed, inversions, and ride duration. The goal is to gain insights into what makes a thrilling roller coaster experience and identify trends in coaster design.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Roller coaster names
- Locations (parks and countries)
- Heights (in feet)
- Speeds (in mph)
- Number of inversions
- Ride durations (in seconds)
- Manufacturers

## Key Findings
- **Height vs. Speed Relationship**: Taller roller coasters tend to have higher speeds, confirming the effect of gravitational potential energy.
- **Number of Inversions**: Coasters with more inversions tend to have longer ride durations, but extreme inversions may not always mean a better experience.
- **Popular Manufacturers**: Certain manufacturers dominate the industry, consistently producing high-thrill rides.
- **Geographical Distribution**: The USA has the highest number of roller coasters in the dataset, with notable contributions from other countries.

## Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, checking data types, and ensuring consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing speed, height, and inversion distributions.
   - Checking correlations between different features.
   - Identifying top manufacturers.
3. **Insights & Conclusion**: Summarizing trends in roller coaster design.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration
